T Cubed Framework Alternate Documentation Info
----------------------------------------------

For developers using T Cubed Framework to build applications, the build system
contains mechanisms for repackaging the source code tree with alternate
documentation.

By default, the 'repackage' target will copy the entire source tree, leaving
the documentation intact. For some applications it might be desirable to
provide multiple packages using different licenses. For instance, if your game
is commercial software but you provide a demo version you want to license under
an open source license.

You can put the alternative documents in the 'docs_alt' folder and set the
'APP_REPACKAGE_DOCS' variable to point to the alternate documents and they will
be copied to the repackaged source tree, overwriting the files in 'docs' if
they exist. For example:

APP_REPACKAGE_DOCS = ../docs_alt/floss/*

This setting will copy all the files in that folder to the 'docs' folder,
effectively relicensing the software when building the 'repackage' target.
