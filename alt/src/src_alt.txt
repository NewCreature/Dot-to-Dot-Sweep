T Cubed Framework Alternate Source Code Info
--------------------------------------------

For developers using T Cubed Framework to build applications, the build system
contains mechanisms for repackaging the source code tree with alternate
source code.

The primary purpose of this is to enable source code trees to contain private
code that doesn't get packaged into the source code package but is included in
the alternate source code tree. This might be desirable of your game is using
proprietary APIs that fall under NDA (Switch port, for instance).

Setting the 'APP_REPACKAGE_SRC' variable informs the build system to copy the
specified files during repackaging. For example:

APP_REPACKAGE_SRC = ../src_alt/platform.c $(APP_REPACKAGE_DIR)/src

This will copy the 'platform.c' from 'src_alt' to the 'src' folder in the
repackaged source tree.
