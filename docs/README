Dot to Dot Sweep

Description
-----------

Dot to Dot Sweep is an arcade action color matching game. It is designed to be
enjoyed by both casual and hard core players.


Getting Started
---------------

Dot to Dot Sweep comes in two flavors, a desktop version and a mobile version.

In the mobile version the action takes place in the top half of the screen and
input is handled by the bottom half. Menus are displayed on the bottom half of
the screen and may be interacted with via touch. When in the game, the bottom
half of the screen acts as a touch pad.

The desktop version uses the mouse and keyboard. You can interact with menus by
clicking on them. When in the game, you use the mouse to move your character
around the play field.


Playing the Game
----------------

The goal of the game is to clear the board of the colored dots. To do so you
must collect the dots that are the same color as your character by running into
them.

Each time you collect a dot, another dot on the board will change to the
color of your character. Running into a dot that doesn't match your character's
color will cause you to lose a life. Additionally, there are black dots that
cannot be collected and must be avoided. Once all of the non-black colored balls
are collected, the level ends and you move on to the next one.

When you collect a dot, you have a couple of seconds to collect the next dot
before your score multiplier resets. When the multiplier resets, your current
accumulated points are added to your score.

You have three lives and once they are all gone it is game over. Your goal is
simply to get the high score. Your high score is stored locally and you can
optionally compete with players worldwide by enabling the Upload Scores option.
