v1.3
----

[ ]Add achievements.

   [ ]We'll track achievements internally but not have in-game visibility to
      them. We want the achievements to update even if the game is not running
      under Steam. The Steam side will be updated on launch and as achievements
      are unlocked while running through Steam.

[X]Look into full screen not working on Windows.

[X]Add 'APP_DIRECTORY' variable for specifying a directory for config and data
   saves that's separate from the application title. For some apps, we'll want
   to share the location between different versions.

   [X]Default to $APP_TITLE for simplicity.

   [X]Pass $APP_DIRECTORY to compiler arguments in place of $APP_TITLE.

[X]See if we can get ranked leaderboards working.

   [X]Generate user key at startup if one does not exist.

   [X]Update leaderboard script to accept user keys for insertion and selection
      operations. Use of user key will branch to the modern leaderboard style.

      [X]When submitting a score with user key, check if the submitted score is
         better than the existing one for that user key, game, mode, etc.
         before replacing. We need a way to specify if lower or higher is
         better.
      
      [X]Consider removing backwards compatibility since the games have to be
         updated anyway to work with the new site.

[X]Store user save data in separate INI file to enable proper cloud synching.

[X]Find a way to separate config and user data on Windows.

[ ]Prepare Steam release.

   [X]Set up store page.

   [ ]Upload notarized MacOS app bundle.

   [ ]Upload Linux executable.

   [ ]Upload Windows executable.

   [ ]Get ready for Steam Deck verification.

      [ ]Make sure text entry uses SteamWorks so the keyboard pops up.

         [ ]Begin work on Steam Optional open source project.

[ ]Finish XBox controller implementation.

   [ ]Add Linux XBox controller configuration.

   [X]Add Windows XBox controller configuration.

[ ]Make new input system respect user configured dead zone.

[ ]Select one input device at a time. If the player moves the mouse, the input
   device should switch back to mouse until the player moves the controller
   again.

[ ]Show a pause menu when using something other than a pointing device to pause
   the game. Users should be able to decide what to do on whichever device they
   happen to be using.

[ ]If the controller in use disconnects, pause the game.

   [ ]We should try to implement joystick reconfiguration events into the new
      input system. We'll probably need to rework the framework a bit to handle
      this properly.

[ ]Research joystick issues.

   [X]XBox controllers have issues with axes on Linux.

      [X]Fixed by making the default dead zone a bit larger and only selecting
         a stick on a gamepad with axis events if it exceeds the dead zone.
   
   [X]Implement new input module in T3F (see 'T3F/issues.txt' for more info).

   [ ]Steam will map input from controllers to XBox mapping for us. We need to
      detect if the game is running through Steam and use XBox mapping if that
      is the case. This means we don't need to use SteamInput, but we'll still
      need to detect if game is running through Steam.

      [ ]I think the simplest way to detect Steam is to see if SteamWorks will
         initialize. We should try to do this during t3f_initialize() so we
         can make informed decisions from our game's init code about input
         configuration.
      
      [ ]Make XBox-style input default in the new input module. We might
         consider just assuming XBox and letting the user override the settings
         if it's not working for them.

[X]Look into issue where name entry menu did not dismiss properly, leaving the
   text entry mode on while on another menu.

   [X]Don't accept menu navigation keys when in text input mode. The menu
      malfunctions when using keys associated with menu navigation.

[ ]Had issue where lifting finger during gameplay would not pause the game on
   Android.

[X]Implement fallback system for graphics loading. If all graphics don't load,
   fall back to the previous multiplier until we succeed.

[X]Test graphics for all size multipliers.

[X]Look into score particles being one pixel too tall.

   [X]Move particle list generation to main init routine. Load the size 16 font
      as 1x temporarily while we generate the particle list.

[X]Look into first frame being wrong at game start when running at low frame
   rate during testing. I think it might be caused by rendering happening
   before the level color is calculated in the logic. If that's the case, we
   can prime that variable at game init.

[X]Use Android functionality to run URLs for T3Net.

   [X]Implemented, but doesn't seem to work. Needs debugging.

[X]When controller active, ensure menu item is selected.

[X]Update server-side leaderboard code.

   [X]There should only be one version of the leaderboard code on the site.

   [X]The current code doesn't seem to produce any output. Probably some syntax
      error in the PHP code.

[X]Check for initial click during gameplay so we don't drop onto the board if
   if we already had the mouse button down.

[X]Window is too small on Macs with high resolution display. Consider adding
   option to set the window size.

   [X]Added optimal window size detection.

[X]Consider adding a small border around the gameplay area in the desktop
   version. I find I frequently accidentally venture slightly outside the game
   window, causing the game to pause.

   [X]The game now starts in full screen, so this isn't as big of an issue any
      more.

[X]Make dots with other dots behind them translucent. Sometimes a dot is hiding
   under another dot, causing the player to unfairly lose.

[X]Score particles sometimes aren't shaped like the number characters they are
   supposed to be based on.

[X]Enable controller support. All 'sticks' should be scanned and player
   movement should be controllable with the first two axes. Any button should
   be usable for selection.

[X]Enable keyboard support. Cursor keys or WASD should be usable for movement.
   Enter and Space Bar should be usable for selection.

[X]When moving character in a straight line, the angle lands incorrectly. We
   might want to disable the jitter protection when using controllers.

[ ]Moving mouse when controller is enabled causes the player position to jump
   to incorrect location for a frame or two.

   [ ]Thought this was fixed, but noticed it happened again.

[X]Pushing controller button should pause game.

[X]Pushing diagonally on d-pad or keyboard keys should mimic the circular shape
   of gamepad analog sticks.

   [X]Use distance formula on final x and y values. If distance > 1.0, get the
      angle and use cos() and sin() to update the final value.

[X]HUD does not render all the way to the edge under certain circumstances.

   [X]Modified t3f_set_clipping_rectangle() to attempt fix. Needs testing.

[X]Darkening overlay during game start and pause states doesn't cover the
   entire play area under certain circumstances.

   [X]Modified t3f_set_clipping_rectangle() to attempt fix. Needs testing.

[X]Add Quit option to main menu so gamepad players don't have to reach for the
   keyboard.

[X]Use T3F font engine to generate high resolution font based on target
   resolution.

[X]Menu system doesn't behave properly on item hover. Item should hover up and
   to the right to match aesthetic. Shadow also appears to be too dark.


Old Issues
----------

[X]Adjust ball size to make game more playable on phones. This will require
   adjusting the level setup charts as well.

[X]Implement online leaderboards.

[X]Implement options.

[X]Add combo time indicator.

   [X]I am thinking a translucent circle that diminishes as the timer runs down
      will do the trick nicely.

[X]Add particle effects.

   [X]Each collected dot should spray particles.

   [X]Smashing into incorrect colored dot should spray particles.

   [X]Possibly generate a large spray of particles to indicate certain points
      thresholds, similar to Quadnet.

      [X]Particles each time score multiplier resets and points are added to
         score.

[X]Display received points somehow.

   See above issue.

[X]Possibly make level speed multiplier dependent on number of collected balls
   instead of elapsed time.

[X]Fix text shadows to match other graphics.

[X]Render higher resolution of combo graphic since we scale it up quite a bit.

[X]Make sure we handle halt and resume correctly for Android.

[X]Implement level colors.

   [X]There will be 10 different level colors. Every 10 levels the same colors
      will repeat in darker variations.

   [X]Colors will probably start with sky blue and transition over to red for
      the final color.

[X]Add cancel/back option to menus where applicable.

[X]Show leaderboard after each game when upload is enabled. If your score is on
   the list, it should be highlighted.

   [X]This screen should display a menu to play again or go back to the intro
      screen.

[X]Add proper cleanup at exit.

[X]Write documentation.

   [X]Need changelog.

   [X]Need readme.

   [X]Need license.

[X]Add in-game privacy statement.

[X]Finish credits.

[X]Finalize HUD layout.

   [X]Need to show number of lives remaining.

   [X]Need to space everything out so it looks nice.

   [X]Implement emotion graphics.

      [X]Character representation on the HUD should react to what's happening
         in the game.

         [X]Need to replace emotion graphics with ones that match the size of
            the in-game graphics.

[X]Add intro screen music.

[X]Change outline of black dot from white to black.

[X]Tweak level colors.

   [X]Adjust level colors so we don't get levels that hurt the player's eyes.

[X]Seed leaderboard.

   [X]Erase old scores and add low placeholder scores.

[X]Release game.

   [X]Post announcement on the web site.

   [X]Post announcement on Facebook.

[X]Add color blind mode.

   [X]Probably just add an indicator that shows which dots you can currently
      collect.

[X]Make a desktop version.

   [X]Desktop version should cut out the track pad area. This will require
      adding a separate state for the desktop menu screen.

   [X]Use a variable to toggle desktop mode. This way we can still get mobile
      mode with a command line switch when we want to record a demo video.

   [X]Only use ALLEGRO_ANDROID to autodetect the mobile version. Make other
      logic use the desktop/mobile variable.

   [X]Use mouse control the game.

   [X]Need to wait for click before starting game.

   [X]Need to wait for click to unpause game.

   [X]Right-click to pause.

   [X]Pause when mouse leaves play area.

   [X]Add ability to enter profile name.

   [X]Put intro menu off screen and transition from title to menu when mouse
      clicked (transition should be quick). Pressing escape will transition
      back to the title screen.

   [X]Click to dismiss leaderboard since we can't show the menu.

      [X]Go to retry menu if we are in the post-game leaderboard screen.

[X]Show profile menu on first launch.
