Dot to Dot Sweep Issues
-----------------------

[ ]Adjust ball size to make game more playable on phones. This will require
   adjusting the level setup charts as well.

[ ]Add particle effects.

   [ ]Each collected dot should spray particles.

   [ ]Smashing into incorrect colored dot should spray particles.

   [ ]Points received for collecting dots should be shown above collection
      point.

   [ ]Possibly generate a large spray of particles to indicate certain points
      thresholds, similar to Quadnet.

[ ]Possibly make level speed multiplier dependent on number of collected balls
   instead of elapsed time.

[ ]Implement online leaderboards.

[ ]Implement options.

[ ]Possibly add music.

[ ]Refactor code.

   [ ]Add a resources structure and pass that to functions that need to access
      the resources.

   [ ]Don't pass the APP_INSTANCE around unnecessarily. Gameplay calls should
      only pass the game data and maybe the resources data.

   [ ]In places that need APP_INSTANCE data, pass an APP_INSTANCE * instead of
      a void * to reduce code and avoid extra casts.
