Dot to Dot Sweep Issues
-----------------------

[X]Adjust ball size to make game more playable on phones. This will require
   adjusting the level setup charts as well.

[X]Implement online leaderboards.

[X]Implement options.

[X]Add combo time indicator.

   [X]I am thinking a translucent circle that diminishes as the timer runs down
      will do the trick nicely.

[ ]Add particle effects.

   [X]Each collected dot should spray particles.

   [X]Smashing into incorrect colored dot should spray particles.

   [X]Possibly generate a large spray of particles to indicate certain points
      thresholds, similar to Quadnet.

      [X]Particles each time score multiplier resets and points are added to
         score.

   [ ]Add small amount of particles around the player for each collected dot.

[X]Display received points somehow.

   See above issue.

[X]Possibly make level speed multiplier dependent on number of collected balls
   instead of elapsed time.

[X]Fix text shadows to match other graphics.

[ ]Finalize HUD layout.

[ ]Render higher resolution of combo graphic since we scale it up quite a bit.

[ ]Possibly add music.

[ ]Make sure we handle halt and resume correctly for Android.

[ ]Refactor code.

   [ ]Add a resources structure and pass that to functions that need to access
      the resources.

   [ ]Don't pass the APP_INSTANCE around unnecessarily. Gameplay calls should
      only pass the game data and maybe the resources data.

   [ ]In places that need APP_INSTANCE data, pass an APP_INSTANCE * instead of
      a void * to reduce code and avoid extra casts.
