Dot to Dot Sweep Issues
-----------------------

[X]Adjust ball size to make game more playable on phones. This will require
   adjusting the level setup charts as well.

[X]Implement online leaderboards.

[X]Implement options.

[X]Add combo time indicator.

   [X]I am thinking a translucent circle that diminishes as the timer runs down
      will do the trick nicely.

[X]Add particle effects.

   [X]Each collected dot should spray particles.

   [X]Smashing into incorrect colored dot should spray particles.

   [X]Possibly generate a large spray of particles to indicate certain points
      thresholds, similar to Quadnet.

      [X]Particles each time score multiplier resets and points are added to
         score.

[X]Display received points somehow.

   See above issue.

[X]Possibly make level speed multiplier dependent on number of collected balls
   instead of elapsed time.

[X]Fix text shadows to match other graphics.

[X]Render higher resolution of combo graphic since we scale it up quite a bit.

[X]Make sure we handle halt and resume correctly for Android.

[X]Implement level colors.

   [X]There will be 10 different level colors. Every 10 levels the same colors
      will repeat in darker variations.

   [X]Colors will probably start with sky blue and transition over to red for
      the final color.

[X]Add cancel/back option to menus where applicable.

[X]Show leaderboard after each game when upload is enabled. If your score is on
   the list, it should be highlighted.

   [X]This screen should display a menu to play again or go back to the intro
      screen.

[ ]Finalize HUD layout.

   [ ]Need to show number of lives remaining.

   [ ]Need to space everything out so it looks nice.

   [ ]Implement emotion graphics.

      [ ]Character representation on the HUD should react to what's happening
         in the game.

         [ ]Need to replace emotion graphics with ones that match the size of
            the in-game graphics.

[ ]Add intro screen music.

[ ]Finish credits.

[ ]Add in-game privacy statement.

[ ]Add proper cleanup at exit.

[ ]Make a desktop version.

   [ ]Desktop version should cut out the track pad area. This will require
      adding a separate state for the desktop menu screen.

   [ ]Use mouse control the game.

   [ ]Pause with Escape key.

      [ ]Need a pause menu so we can quit or resume game like a normal desktop
         game.

   [ ]Use a variable to toggle desktop mode. This way we can still get mobile
      mode with a command line switch when we want to record a demo video.

[ ]Write documentation.

   [X]Need changelog.

   [X]Need readme.

   [ ]Need license.

[ ]Make demo video.

[ ]Create project page.

   [ ]Add project to database.

   [ ]Upload screenshots.

   [ ]Upload all versions of the game.

   [ ]Upload soundtrack packages.

[ ]Create store listing for Google Play.

   [ ]Create promo graphics.

   [ ]Upload APK.

[ ]Release game.

   [ ]Post announcement on the web site.

   [ ]Post announcement on Facebook.
