v1.2.1
------

[ ]Check for initial click during gameplay so we don't drop onto the board if
   if we already had the mouse button down.

[ ]Window is too small on Macs with high resolution display. Consider adding
   option to set the window size.

[ ]Consider adding a small border around the gameplay area in the desktop
   version. I find I frequently accidentally venture slightly outside the game
   window, causing the game to pause.

[ ]Make dots with other dots behind them translucent. Sometimes a dot is hiding
   under another dot, causing the player to unfairly lose.


Old Issues
----------

[X]Adjust ball size to make game more playable on phones. This will require
   adjusting the level setup charts as well.

[X]Implement online leaderboards.

[X]Implement options.

[X]Add combo time indicator.

   [X]I am thinking a translucent circle that diminishes as the timer runs down
      will do the trick nicely.

[X]Add particle effects.

   [X]Each collected dot should spray particles.

   [X]Smashing into incorrect colored dot should spray particles.

   [X]Possibly generate a large spray of particles to indicate certain points
      thresholds, similar to Quadnet.

      [X]Particles each time score multiplier resets and points are added to
         score.

[X]Display received points somehow.

   See above issue.

[X]Possibly make level speed multiplier dependent on number of collected balls
   instead of elapsed time.

[X]Fix text shadows to match other graphics.

[X]Render higher resolution of combo graphic since we scale it up quite a bit.

[X]Make sure we handle halt and resume correctly for Android.

[X]Implement level colors.

   [X]There will be 10 different level colors. Every 10 levels the same colors
      will repeat in darker variations.

   [X]Colors will probably start with sky blue and transition over to red for
      the final color.

[X]Add cancel/back option to menus where applicable.

[X]Show leaderboard after each game when upload is enabled. If your score is on
   the list, it should be highlighted.

   [X]This screen should display a menu to play again or go back to the intro
      screen.

[X]Add proper cleanup at exit.

[X]Write documentation.

   [X]Need changelog.

   [X]Need readme.

   [X]Need license.

[X]Add in-game privacy statement.

[X]Finish credits.

[X]Finalize HUD layout.

   [X]Need to show number of lives remaining.

   [X]Need to space everything out so it looks nice.

   [X]Implement emotion graphics.

      [X]Character representation on the HUD should react to what's happening
         in the game.

         [X]Need to replace emotion graphics with ones that match the size of
            the in-game graphics.

[X]Add intro screen music.

[X]Change outline of black dot from white to black.

[X]Tweak level colors.

   [X]Adjust level colors so we don't get levels that hurt the player's eyes.

[X]Create project page.

   [X]Add project to database.

   [X]Upload screenshots.

   [X]Upload all versions of the game.

   [X]Upload soundtrack packages.

   [X]Create promo graphics.

   [X]Upload APK.

[X]Make demo video.

[X]Seed leaderboard.

   [X]Erase old scores and add low placeholder scores.

[X]Release game.

   [X]Post announcement on the web site.

   [X]Post announcement on Facebook.

[X]Add color blind mode.

   [X]Probably just add an indicator that shows which dots you can currently
      collect.

[X]Make a desktop version.

   [X]Desktop version should cut out the track pad area. This will require
      adding a separate state for the desktop menu screen.

   [X]Use a variable to toggle desktop mode. This way we can still get mobile
      mode with a command line switch when we want to record a demo video.

   [X]Only use ALLEGRO_ANDROID to autodetect the mobile version. Make other
      logic use the desktop/mobile variable.

   [X]Use mouse control the game.

   [X]Need to wait for click before starting game.

   [X]Need to wait for click to unpause game.

   [X]Right-click to pause.

   [X]Pause when mouse leaves play area.

   [X]Add ability to enter profile name.

   [X]Put intro menu off screen and transition from title to menu when mouse
      clicked (transition should be quick). Pressing escape will transition
      back to the title screen.

   [X]Click to dismiss leaderboard since we can't show the menu.

      [X]Go to retry menu if we are in the post-game leaderboard screen.

[X]Show profile menu on first launch.
