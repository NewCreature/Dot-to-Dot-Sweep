v1.2.2
------

[ ]Look into score particles being one pixel too tall.

   [ ]Move particle list generation to main init routine. Load the size 16 font
      as 1x temporarily while we generate the particle list.

[ ]Look into first frame being wrong at game start when running at low frame
   rate during testing. I think it might be caused by rendering happening
   before the level color is calculated in the logic. If that's the case, we
   can prime that variable at game init.

[X]Use Android functionality to run URLs for T3Net.

   [X]Implemented, but doesn't seem to work. Needs debugging.

[X]When controller active, ensure menu item is selected.

[X]Update server-side leaderboard code.

   [X]There should only be one version of the leaderboard code on the site.

   [X]The current code doesn't seem to produce any output. Probably some syntax
      error in the PHP code.

[X]Check for initial click during gameplay so we don't drop onto the board if
   if we already had the mouse button down.

[X]Window is too small on Macs with high resolution display. Consider adding
   option to set the window size.

   [X]Added optimal window size detection.

[X]Consider adding a small border around the gameplay area in the desktop
   version. I find I frequently accidentally venture slightly outside the game
   window, causing the game to pause.

   [X]The game now starts in full screen, so this isn't as big of an issue any
      more.

[X]Make dots with other dots behind them translucent. Sometimes a dot is hiding
   under another dot, causing the player to unfairly lose.

[X]Score particles sometimes aren't shaped like the number characters they are
   supposed to be based on.

[X]Enable controller support. All 'sticks' should be scanned and player
   movement should be controllable with the first two axes. Any button should
   be usable for selection.

[X]Enable keyboard support. Cursor keys or WASD should be usable for movement.
   Enter and Space Bar should be usable for selection.

[X]When moving character in a straight line, the angle lands incorrectly. We
   might want to disable the jitter protection when using controllers.

[ ]Moving mouse when controller is enabled causes the player position to jump
   to incorrect location for a frame or two.

   [ ]Thought this was fixed, but noticed it happened again.

[X]Pushing controller button should pause game.

[X]Pushing diagonally on d-pad or keyboard keys should mimic the circular shape
   of gamepad analog sticks.

   [X]Use distance formula on final x and y values. If distance > 1.0, get the
      angle and use cos() and sin() to update the final value.

[ ]HUD does not render all the way to the edge under certain circumstances.

   [ ]Modified t3f_set_clipping_rectangle() to attempt fix. Needs testing.

[ ]Darkening overlay during game start and pause states doesn't cover the
   entire play area under certain circumstances.

   [ ]Modified t3f_set_clipping_rectangle() to attempt fix. Needs testing.

[ ]Add Quit option to main menu so gamepad players don't have to reach for the
   keyboard.

[X]Use T3F font engine to generate high resolution font based on target
   resolution.

[X]Menu system doesn't behave properly on item hover. Item should hover up and
   to the right to match aesthetic. Shadow also appears to be too dark.


Old Issues
----------

[X]Adjust ball size to make game more playable on phones. This will require
   adjusting the level setup charts as well.

[X]Implement online leaderboards.

[X]Implement options.

[X]Add combo time indicator.

   [X]I am thinking a translucent circle that diminishes as the timer runs down
      will do the trick nicely.

[X]Add particle effects.

   [X]Each collected dot should spray particles.

   [X]Smashing into incorrect colored dot should spray particles.

   [X]Possibly generate a large spray of particles to indicate certain points
      thresholds, similar to Quadnet.

      [X]Particles each time score multiplier resets and points are added to
         score.

[X]Display received points somehow.

   See above issue.

[X]Possibly make level speed multiplier dependent on number of collected balls
   instead of elapsed time.

[X]Fix text shadows to match other graphics.

[X]Render higher resolution of combo graphic since we scale it up quite a bit.

[X]Make sure we handle halt and resume correctly for Android.

[X]Implement level colors.

   [X]There will be 10 different level colors. Every 10 levels the same colors
      will repeat in darker variations.

   [X]Colors will probably start with sky blue and transition over to red for
      the final color.

[X]Add cancel/back option to menus where applicable.

[X]Show leaderboard after each game when upload is enabled. If your score is on
   the list, it should be highlighted.

   [X]This screen should display a menu to play again or go back to the intro
      screen.

[X]Add proper cleanup at exit.

[X]Write documentation.

   [X]Need changelog.

   [X]Need readme.

   [X]Need license.

[X]Add in-game privacy statement.

[X]Finish credits.

[X]Finalize HUD layout.

   [X]Need to show number of lives remaining.

   [X]Need to space everything out so it looks nice.

   [X]Implement emotion graphics.

      [X]Character representation on the HUD should react to what's happening
         in the game.

         [X]Need to replace emotion graphics with ones that match the size of
            the in-game graphics.

[X]Add intro screen music.

[X]Change outline of black dot from white to black.

[X]Tweak level colors.

   [X]Adjust level colors so we don't get levels that hurt the player's eyes.

   [X]Erase old scores and add low placeholder scores.

[X]Release game.

   [X]Post announcement on the web site.

   [X]Post announcement on Facebook.

[X]Add color blind mode.

   [X]Probably just add an indicator that shows which dots you can currently
      collect.

[X]Make a desktop version.

   [X]Desktop version should cut out the track pad area. This will require
      adding a separate state for the desktop menu screen.

   [X]Use a variable to toggle desktop mode. This way we can still get mobile
      mode with a command line switch when we want to record a demo video.

   [X]Only use ALLEGRO_ANDROID to autodetect the mobile version. Make other
      logic use the desktop/mobile variable.

   [X]Use mouse control the game.

   [X]Need to wait for click before starting game.

   [X]Need to wait for click to unpause game.

   [X]Right-click to pause.

   [X]Pause when mouse leaves play area.

   [X]Add ability to enter profile name.

   [X]Put intro menu off screen and transition from title to menu when mouse
      clicked (transition should be quick). Pressing escape will transition
      back to the title screen.

   [X]Click to dismiss leaderboard since we can't show the menu.

      [X]Go to retry menu if we are in the post-game leaderboard screen.

[X]Show profile menu on first launch.
